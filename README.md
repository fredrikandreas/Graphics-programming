# PROG20002 Graphics Programming

## Evaluation

This is a NOT PASS. Unfortunately, I can't pass this since the rotations/zooming are not implemented correctly. There is no effect on rotations, and zooming, even though the input management correctly detects the keystrokes. I suspect the error is either on the camera management or on your calculations.

If you think this evaluation is not correct, please contact me and we can review it together. As it stands, this cannot pass.
